Nifty Windows (http://www.enovatic.org/products/niftywindows/introduction/) is a *necessary* utility for MS Windows so that window management isn't hard. It adds things like easy window dragging.

This is a clone of their code, updated to have 

<win> + h => send current window to tray
double right click => close current window

=== features that were already there that I use ==
right drag -> drag window
right drag near edge -> resize window


How to install:
download and run file from: http://github.com/rogerdpack/nifty_windows/downloads

Known bugs:
When it's running, you can't right click on items in your programs menu.  Work around currently is to disable nifty windows, do what you need, then restart it.


TODO: either make the key bindings configurable, or just arbitrarily change them to be nice like what I want them to be.

TODO: add a list of all key bindings to the right click popup so people can at least know what is possible.
